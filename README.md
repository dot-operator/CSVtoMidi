# Histogram, the automatic data sonifier.

Histogram is a VST audio plugin that converts comma-separated files into music notes. You can control how the data maps onto pitch and the output rhythm with the plugin GUI.
The mapping can be controlled with automation in your DAW, and it will automatically sync the playback of the data to your transport based on the rhythm settings.

A sample of the output can be heard [here](https://soundcloud.com/dot_operator/sonifiedsix).

It was designed to work with climate data (specifically, rainfall) from FSU, which can be found [here](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data).

Built with the [JUCE](https://juce.com) library.
